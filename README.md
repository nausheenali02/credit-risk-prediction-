💳 Credit Risk Prediction – End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This project is an end-to-end Credit Risk Prediction system that evaluates loan applicants and classifies them into Approve, Manual Review, or Reject categories based on financial and demographic information.
The goal is to demonstrate how a machine learning model can be taken from data preprocessing to real-time deployment with a backend API and a web-based frontend.

🚀 Project Overview:-
Financial institutions need reliable systems to assess the creditworthiness of applicants.
This project solves that problem by:
Training a machine learning model on credit-related data
Predicting the probability of default
Applying decision thresholds for real-world usage
Serving predictions through a Flask REST API
Displaying results via a frontend web interface

🧠 Machine Learning Approach:-
Problem Type: Binary Classification
Target Variable: Loan Status (Default / No Default)
Model Used: Random Forest Classifier
